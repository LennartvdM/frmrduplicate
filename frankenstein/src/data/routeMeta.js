/**
 * routeMeta.js — one description of every page, for two consumers.
 *
 * The app is a single index.html served for every path, so without this
 * each route inherited the homepage's <title>, description and canonical.
 * That told Google the canonical version of /publications was the
 * homepage, and made every shared link preview show the homepage.
 *
 * Two things read this file and must never disagree:
 *   - hooks/useDocumentMeta.js  updates the head on client-side navigation
 *   - scripts/build-route-html.mjs  writes a real HTML file per route at
 *     build time, because social scrapers don't run JavaScript and only
 *     ever see the raw markup
 *
 * That second consumer is plain Node, so nothing here may import JSON,
 * touch import.meta.env, or use a Vite glob. Page data arrives as an
 * argument instead.
